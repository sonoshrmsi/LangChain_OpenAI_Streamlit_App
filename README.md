# LangChain_OpenAI_Streamlit_App

# Readme

This repository contains code for a frontend demo of an application that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for providing guidance in application documentation. The application leverages Streamlit, PyPDF2, pdf2image, dotenv, and Langchain libraries.

## Installation

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Make sure you have the necessary environment variables set up. You can use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
4. Run the application using the command `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow these steps to use it:

1. The application will display a title and a brief introduction describing the benefits of LLMs in application documentation.
2. You will be presented with a selection box to choose an article or document from a pre-defined list.
3. After selecting an article, you can enter a question in the prompt text input field.
4. If a PDF file is associated with the selected article, the application will extract the text from the PDF and split it into chunks.
5. The text chunks will be embedded using the OpenAIEmbeddings model, and a vector search index (FAISS) will be created.
6. You can enter a question in the prompt text input field and click "Submit" to search for an answer within the selected document.
7. The application will use a question-answering model (LLM) to find the most relevant answer to your question based on the document content and prompt patterns.
8. If a matching answer is found, it will be displayed in the application. If the answer is not available or more information is needed, an appropriate message will be shown.
9. Additionally, an example answer will be generated by prompting the LLM with "provide an example of this: [answer]". The example answer will be displayed below the original answer.
10. If the selected document is the "Python book", the example answer will also be displayed as code.
